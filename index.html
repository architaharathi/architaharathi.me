        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4> <strong>Who am I?</strong> </h4>
        <p> I am a first-year undergraduate student, interested in computer science,
       mathematics, and economics at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New
       Hampshire. I was born and brought up in Portland, Oregon.<p>

         <h4> What do I like to do? </h4>
         <p> LOTS of things! I've played a variety of sports throughout my life,
      soccer being one of my favorites. </p>

        <p> I am also an Indian Classical
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHqtTLd1_KM">dancer</a> and
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FTBsN_lxmg">singer</a>. </p>
        <img src="images/dance2.jpeg" width=350 height=230 class="center">
        <p> At Dartmouth, I am a member of the Dartmouth Sings (an a cappella
      group), Smart Women Securities, Mock Trial, and WISP. I have also been a
      member of Dartmouth Raaz and the Dartmouth Mathematical Society.</p>
        <img src="images/sings.jpeg" width=350 height=230 class="center">
        <p> But of course, computer science, including learning how to code and
      design, is one of my favorite things yet!

        <h2>Future DALI member?</h2>
        <p> I am extremely excited to be applying to Dartmouth's DALI Lab! I'll
          be honest -- coding was never something I found interest in...until I
          took CS 1 my freshman fall and loved it! I thoroughly enjoyed the class
          and the logic behind programming, so when I heard about WISP, I applied
          specifically to be an WISP research intern with the DALI Lab. Working
          three other freshmen women and an amazing professor and mentor, I have
          learned so <em>so</em> <strong><em>so</em></strong> much about coding
          and have realized that I might want to keep learning and doing it
          for the rest of my life!<p>
         <p> I am tremendously grateful to have been exposed to DALI through WISP
      because I have firsthand seen the wonderful culture of DALI and
      its people. I love the fun emojis people use in the slack, the help
      that members people give to anyone in coding or even just life
      advice, and the auras of positivity and talent, streaming from the snack
      cabinet all the way to the comfy couches and the Mobamba pod. I know it's
      pretty cheesy, but even though I am technically not part of DALI (yet ;)),
      the lab has become a home for me on campus where I know I can make a new
      friend or learn a new skill or two (or twenty!). I am constantly amazed by
      the sheer knowledge and creativity that each person in the lab has. I
      have truly been shown how the world can be changed by powerful, inspiring,
      and passionate people like the students at DALI. I would love to continue
      that legacy and be a model and inspiration to other freshmen in years to
      come. Thank you so much for the opportunity!

        <p>Wow, writing about WISP really touched my little heart and got me
          thinking about my amazing group as our project comes to an end.
