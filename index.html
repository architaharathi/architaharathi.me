    <p>Welcome to my world.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> <strong>Who am I?</strong> </p>
    <p> I am a first-year undergraduate student, intersted in computer science,
       mathematics, and economics at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New
       Hampshire. I was born and brought up in Portland, Oregon.<p>
    <img src="images/dartmouth.jpeg" width=200 height=250>
    <p> <strong>What do I like to do?</strong> </p>
    <p> LOTS of things! I've played a variety of sports throughout my life,
      soccer being one of my favorites. </p>

    <p> I am also an Indian Classical dancer and singer. </p>

    <p> At Dartmouth, I am a member of the Dartmouth Sings (an a cappella
      group), Smart Women Securities, Mock Trial, and WISP. I have also been a member of
      Dartmouth Raaz and the Dartmouth Mathematical Society.</p>

    <p> But of course, computer science, specifically learning how to code and
      design, are some of my favorite things yet.

    <h2>Future DALI-ite?</h2>
    <p> I am extremely excited to be applying to Darmtouth's DALI Lab! I'll be
       honest -- coding was never something I found interest in...until I took
       CS 1 my freshman fall and loved it! I thoroughly enjoyed the class and
       the logic behind programming, so when I heard about WISP, I applied
       specifically to be an WISP research intern with the DALI Lab. Working
       three other freshman women and an amazing professor and mentor, I have
       learned so <em>so</em> <strong><em>so</em></strong> much about coding
       and have realized that I might want to keep learning and doing it
       for the rest of my life!<p>
    <p> I am tremendously grateful to have been exposed to DALI through WISP
      because I have firsthand seen the wonderful, giving culture of DALI and
      its people. I love the fun emojis people use in the slack, the help
      that people provide to anyone and everyone in coding or even just life
      advice, and the aura of positivity and talent that stream from the snack
      cabinet all the way to the comfy couches and the Mobamba pod. I know it's
      pretty cheesy, but even though I am technically not part of DALI (yet ;)),
      the lab has become a home for me on campus where I know I can make a new
      friend or learn a new skill or two (or twenty!). I am constantly amazed by
      the sheer knowledge and creativity that each person in the lab has and
      have truly been shown how the world can be changed by powerful, inspiring,
      and passionate people like the students at DALI. I would love to continue
      that legacy and be a model and inspiration to other freshmen in years to
      come.Thank you so much for the opportunity!

     <p>Wow, writing those paragraphs really touched my little heart and got
       me thinking about my amazing WISP group as our project comes to an end.
